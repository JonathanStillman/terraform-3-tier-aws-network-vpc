## Overview

The Terraform code in this repository sets up an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) along with associated subnets, route tables, and an internet gateway. Additionally, it deploys resources using an ECS (Elastic Container Service) configuration for the Jupiter website.

## Prerequisites

Before using this Terraform configuration, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed.
- AWS CLI configured with necessary access rights.
- AWS S3 bucket for storing Terraform state (if using backend configuration).

- `AWS_NETWORK_VPC`: Terraform configuration for the VPC.
- `jupiter-website-ecs`: Terraform configuration for ECS and website deployment.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/jupiter-aws-infrastructure.git
   cd jupiter-aws-infrastructure
   ```

2. Update variable values in `terraform.tfvars` files.

3. Initialize Terraform:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. Apply the Terraform configuration:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

## Variables

- **AWS_NETWORK_VPC:**
  - `region`: AWS region.
  - `project_name`: Name for the project.
  - `vpc_cidr`: CIDR block for the VPC.
  - ... (other variables)

- **jupiter-website-ecs:**
  - `region`: AWS region.
  - `project_name`: Name for the project.
  - ... (other variables)

Refer to the respective `terraform.tfvars` files for variable values.

## Terraform State

This Terraform configuration uses backend configuration to store the state file in an S3 bucket. Ensure that the backend configuration in `backend.tf` is updated with the correct S3 bucket details.
